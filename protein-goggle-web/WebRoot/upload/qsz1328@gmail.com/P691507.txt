CC   -!- FUNCTION: Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and
CC       compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the
CC       cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones
CC       thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA
CC       repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA
CC       accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational
CC       modifications of histones, also called histone code, and
CC       nucleosome remodeling. H3 is deposited into chromatin exclusively
CC       through a DNA replication-coupled pathway that can be associated
CC       with either DNA duplication or DNA repair synthesis during meiotic
CC       homologous recombination.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: The nucleosome is a histone octamer containing two
CC       molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 assembled in one H3-H4
CC       heterotetramer and two H2A-H2B heterodimers. The octamer wraps
CC       approximately 147 bp of DNA. Interacts with GCN5, whereby H3S10ph
CC       increases histone-protein interactions. Interacts with PDD1 and
CC       PDD3.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Chromosome. Note=Localizes to both
CC       the large, transcriptionally active, somatic macronucleus (MAC)
CC       and the small, transcriptionally inert, germ line micronucleus
CC       (MIC).
CC   -!- INDUCTION: Highly expressed in growing cells, but only at low
CC       levels in starved cells.
CC   -!- PTM: Phosphorylated to form H3S10ph. H3S10ph promotes subsequent
CC       H3K14ac formation by GCN5. H3S10ph is only found in the
CC       mitotically dividing MIC, but not in the amitotically dividing
CC       MAC. H3S10ph is correlated with chromosome condensation during
CC       mitotic or meiotic micronuclear divisions.
CC   -!- PTM: Acetylation of histone H3 leads to transcriptional
CC       activation. H3K14ac formation by GCN5 is promoted by H3S10ph.
CC       H3K9acK14ac is the preferred acetylated form of newly synthesized
CC       H3. Acetylation occurs almost exclusively in the MAC.
CC   -!- PTM: Methylated to form H3K4me. H3K4me is only found in the
CC       transcriptionally active MAC. Methylated to form H3K9me in
CC       developing MACs during conjugation, when genome-wide DNA
CC       elimination occurs. At this stage, H3K9me specifically occurs on
CC       DNA sequences being eliminated (IES), probably targeted by small
CC       scan RNAs (scnRNAs) bound to IES, and is required for efficient
CC       IES elimination. H3K9me is required for the interaction with the
CC       chromodomains of PDD1 and PDD3.
CC   -!- PTM: The full-length protein H3S (slow migrating) is converted to
CC       H3F (fast migrating) by proteolytic removal of the first 6
CC       residues. H3F is unique to MIC, and processing seems to occur
CC       regularly each generation at a specific point in the cell cycle.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone H3 family.
CC   -!- CAUTION: To ensure consistency between histone entries, we follow
CC       the 'Brno' nomenclature for histone modifications, with positions
CC       referring to those used in the literature for the 'closest' model
CC       organism. Due to slight variations in histone sequences between
CC       organisms and to the presence of initiator methionine in
CC       UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot sequences, the actual positions of modified
CC       amino acids in the sequence generally differ. In this entry the
CC       following conventions are used: H3K4ac = acetylated Lys-5;
CC       H3K4me1/2/3 = mono-, di- and trimethylated Lys-5; H3K9ac =
CC       acetylated Lys-10; H3K9me3 = trimethylated Lys-10; H3S10ph =
CC       phosphorylated Ser-11; H3K14ac = acetylated Lys-15; H3K18ac =
CC       acetylated Lys-19; H3K23ac = acetylated Lys-24; H3K27ac =
CC       acetylated Lys-28; H3K27me1/2/3 = mono-, di- and trimethylated
CC       Lys-28; H3K36ac = acetylated Lys-37; H3K36me1/3/3 = mono-, di- and
CC       trimethylated Lys-37; H3K56ac = acetylated Lys-57; H3K56me1 =
CC       monomethylated Lys-57; H3K79me1 = monomethylated Lys-80.
